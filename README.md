This implementation includes:

1. **Employee Class**:
- Stores employee information (ID, name, department, position, salary)
- Includes methods for calculating total salary with overtime
- Getters and setters for employee attributes

2. **EmployeeManagement Class**:
- Manages a collection of employees
- Implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Includes features for:
  - Adding new employees with duplicate ID checking
  - Finding employees by ID
  - Updating employee information
  - Removing employees
  - Displaying employees grouped by department
  - File I/O operations for data persistence
  - Calculating average salary
  - Getting total employee count

3. **Key Features**:
- Input validation for employee IDs
- Proper error handling
- Data persistence using CSV file format
- Formatted output display
- Overtime calculation support
- Department-wise grouping and display

To complete the system, you would need to:

1. Implement the main menu interface
2. Complete the file parsing logic in `loadFromFile()`
3. Add more input validation
4. Implement additional search features (by name)
5. Add more detailed error handling

Would you like me to implement any of these additional features or explain any part of the current implementation in more detail?
